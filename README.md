This project consists on cognite games based on hand detection (close/open hand).

First, when we run game launcher it appears a menu with varied themes such as math, vocabulary, fun and co-op.

Then is each theme you can choose a game.
In the next video appears a game of math, where the player needs to close the hand on the highest number as fast as he can.
